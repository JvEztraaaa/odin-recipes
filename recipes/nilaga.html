    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><em>Adobo</em>, the heart of Filipino comfort food, is a rich, savory dish that combines tender meat, a tangy blend of vinegar and soy sauce, aromatic garlic, 
        bay leaves, and a touch of pepper for that irresistible balance of flavors. My recipe keeps it simple but unforgettable—marinating the meat to perfection, 
        slow-cooking it to juicy tenderness, and letting the sauce caramelize just enough to coat every bite in its golden, umami glory. It’s the perfect mix of classic 
        and homey, bringing a taste of tradition to every spoonful. Perfect with steaming rice, it’s more than a meal—it’s a hug on a plate!</p>

        <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>

    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.</li>
